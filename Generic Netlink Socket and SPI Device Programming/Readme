This Folder contains the following files as per the requirement of the Assignment:

-> main.c  To initiate the netlink connection and pass parameters from user space

-> matrix_driver.h, matrix_driver.c  Implements the distance-matrix mechanism and stores the average distance of the last 5 readings

-> hcsr.h

-> IOinit.h,IOinit.c

-> set_ip Script to set the IP address if needed

-> run Script to run and transfer the files to Galileo

-> Makefile  Compiles and links all the files

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Although the user is able to send the pin request to the kernel space via Netlink socket, I have fixed the trigger, echo and chip select pins as I was facing issues.
trigger - 0
echo - 9
chip select - 8

You can also choose between 2 patterns. 


To run the code:

Run the script files if needed first:
* chmod 777 set_ip ----> ./set_ip
* chmod 777 run ----> ./run

Inside the Galileo:
* insmod matrix_driver.ko

Once insmod is successful,

the user can request to START the distance measure - this leads to kthreads creation that run until STOP is called

* ./main -s -m start

Interrupt handler runs in the background and the speed of pattern varies depending on the distance

* ./main -s -m stop 

Kthread stops and Matrix switches off


* ./main -l 0 (same as sample code) (To read the distance in cm)

This gives the user the average distance.

NOTE: ./main -l <group> can be called even before STOP. It is not dependent on the kthread stopping. If is is called before START, distance will be 0.


* rmmod matrix_driver.ko


I have provided screenshot in the Folder as well.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CODE USES THE  SAMPLE CODE PROVIDED BY PROFESSOR/TA for GENERIC NETLINK.ANY SIMILARITY IN VARIABLE NAMES LIKE GMEM_DEVP IS BECAUSE OF THE SAME REASON.*
